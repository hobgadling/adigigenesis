Connections:
	The three high bits and the three low bits of each instruction can bind with the appropriate three bits of the surrounding instructions if the bits XOR to 1
		Triple bond if top 3 bits of one instructions XOR to 111 with low three bits of previous instruction - 8 Energy
		Double bond if top 2 bits of one instructions XOR to 11 with low two bits of previous instruction - 4 Energy
		Single bond if top bit of one instructions XORs to 1 with low bit of previous instruction - 2 Energy
	Nothing binds to 0x0000
	Connections are made to the most energetic bond first, and then clockwise around the cell if there are multiple connections at the same energy level
	The minimum instruction angle is 90 degrees
	If the low bits have a more energetic connection they will connect first, and vice-versa; if both low and high bits are trying to connect at the same energy level, the low bits of the instruction will connect first
